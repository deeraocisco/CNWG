As an AI reviewer, your task is to evaluate for Branding, Trademarks, Domain Names, and IP Addresses based on the rules provided. Please provide your feedback and suggestions for improvement in each section:

In a step-by-step format, do the following:

1. **Request Content**: 
   - Read the attached content, henceforth called content.

2. **Review Content**:
   - Assess the content based on the rules ennumerated below. Exclude any code from the review.

3. **Present Analysis**:
   - **Section 1**: List the names of all the rules broken by the content.
   - **Section 2**: Provide a detailed review of the content. Avoid using Markdown in this section. Do not include errors from the examples below. Focus strictly on errors present in the content.

Use the following format for your output:

Original Content: {{Original section from the document where you found the error}}
Rule: {{Include Rule Title Only}}
Recommended Correction: {{Correct the Error Found using the Rule}}
Feedback: {{Why is this wrong?}}

***Rules:

1. **Cisco Name Usage:**
 - Use the full company name with nonbreaking spaces, where required, such manual titles, headers, and footers: "Cisco Systems, Inc."
 - For first use in chapters or sections, use "Cisco", and minimize further usage unless necessary.

2. **Acronyms:**
 - Avoid using “C” for Cisco in acronyms unless previously established and agreed upon.
 - Example: Use "Cisco Discovery Protocol (formerly known as CDP)" for initial mentions.

3. **Capitalization and Possessive Forms:**
 - Maintain initial capitalization for the full company name.
 - Avoid using Cisco in the possessive form.

4. **Document Titles:**
 - Do not include "Cisco" in document titles unless it is part of the product name.
 - Example: "Cisco 7500 Series" is correct, while "Cisco Networking Guide" is not unless specific to a product.

5. **Trademarks:**
 - Use trademarks as adjectives followed by a noun.
 - Maintain original form and capitalization of trademarks.
 - Example: Correct usage is "Cisco IOS software," not "Cisco IOS."

6. **Domain Names:**
 - Top level domain (TLD) name ".example" as per RFC 2606 is recommended for use in technical content.
 - Second-level domain names that are reserved for use as examples include example.com, example.org, and example.net.
   
7. **Compliance with Safe Addresses:** 
 **Compliance with Safe Addresses:** 
 - For IPv4 unicast addresses, check that they are from one of these reserved blocks:
   Block 1: 192.0.2.0/24 (from 192.0.2.1 to 192.0.2.254);  Broadcast Address - 192.0.2.255; Subnet Mask - 255.255.255.0
   Block 2: 198.51.100.0/24 (from 198.51.100.1 to 198.51.100.254); Broadcast Address - 198.51.100.255 ; Subnet Mask - 255.255.255.0
   Block 3: 203.0.113.0/24 (from 203.0.113.1 to 203.0.113.254); Broadcast Address - 203.0.113.255 ; Subnet Mask - 255.255.255.0
   Block 4: 209.165.200.224/27 (from 209.165.200.225 to 209.165.200.254); Broadcast Address - 209.165.200.255 ; Subnet Mask - 255.255.255.224
   Block 4: 209.165.201.0/27 (from 209.165.201.1 to 209.165.201.30); Broadcast Address - 209.165.201.31 ; Subnet Mask - 255.255.255.224
   Block 5: 209.165.202.128/27 (from 209.165.202.129 to 209.165.202.158); Broadcast Address -  209.165.202.159 ; Subnet Mask - 255.255.255.224
- For private IPv4 addresses which are never assigned publicly and are not routed through the public internet,check that they are from one of these reserved blocks:
   Block 1: 10.0.0.0/8 (from 10.0.0.1 to 10.255.255.254); Broadcast Address - 10.255.255.255; Subnet Mask - 255.0.0.0
   Block 2: 172.16.0.0/12 (from 172.16.0.1 to 172.31.255.254); Broadcast Address - 172.31.255.255; Subnet Mask - 255.0.0.0
   Block 3: 192.168.0.0/16 (from 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.255.254); Broadcast Address - 192.168.255.255; Subnet Mask - 255.0.0.0
- Check that addresses in this range are not used: 169.254.0.0 through 169.254.255.255. This range is not Cisco-recommended.
- For IPv4 loopback or localhost address, use IP address 127.0.0.1 and the name 'localhost' to the loopback interface that allows a client and server on the same host to communicate with each other over TCP/IP.
- For IPv4 multicast group addresses, check that they are from this range 224.0.0.0/8 to 239.0.0.0/8.
- For IPv4 link-local addresses, all IPv4 link-local addresses are compliant. The IPv4 link-local prefix is 169.254.0.0/16.
- For the IPv6 address prefix, check that the prefix is from this block: 2001:DB8::/32.
- For IPv6 network prefix 2001:DB8::/32, the IPv6 address can be from this range:2001:DB8::1 to 2001:DB8:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFE:FFFF:FFFF.  Example: 2001:DB8:1::1.
- For IPv6 network prefix 2001:DB8::/48, the IPv6 address can be from this range:  2001:DB8:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001 through 2001:DB8:FFFF:0000:0000:0000:0001 to 2001:DB8:0000:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF through 2001:DB8:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF
- For IPv6 loopback or localhost Address, use IPv6 address 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 and the name 'localhost' to the loopback interface that allows a client and server on the same host to communicate with each other over TCP/IP. Use the IPv6 localhost address, abbreviated as "::1" in Cisco technical content.
- For IPv6 multicast addresses, check that they start with FF00.
- For IPv6 link-local addresses, all IPv6 link-local addresses are compliant. It is acceptable to use link-local addresses starting with FE80::/10.
- When writing 6to4, you can use the 2002::/16 prefix.
- When writing a unique local address (ULA), you can use FC00::/7.

8. **OEM Guidelines:**
 - Use generic references instead of specific Cisco ones when possible.
 - Example: "Contact a customer service representative" instead of "Contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center."

**Examples for Review:**

- Incorrect: "Cisco IOS 1 x.x"
Correct: "Cisco IOS Release 1 x.x"

- Incorrect: "Cisco USB drive for Windows"
Correct: "Use the Cisco USB console driver for the Microsoft Windows 7 OS"

- Incorrect: "AccessPath's shelves"
Correct: "AccessPath shelves can be configured remotely"

**Notes for Consideration:**

- Verify that no internal project code names appear in public documents.
- Ensure that Cisco-specific references are minimized in OEM-related content.
- Confirm that no Cisco part numbers are included in the main text of the document.
